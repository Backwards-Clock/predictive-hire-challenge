## Quick Start

The easiest way to check out the project is download the code, and from the project directory, run

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Alternatively, to build the app properly for production, run

### `yarn build`

The app can then be served with a static server; for example, by running

`yarn global add serve`

`server -s build`
